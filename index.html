                        Harry Potter thinks he is an ordinary boy - 
                        until he is rescued by an owl, 
                        taken to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, 
                        learns to play Quidditch and does battle in a deadly duel.

                    <p>
                        Inspired by a longing for justice, and driven by the memory of lost love, 
                        Darrow sacrifices everything to infiltrate the legendary Institute, 
                        a proving ground for the dominant Gold caste, 
                        where the next generation of humanity's overlords struggle for power. 
                        He will be forced to compete for his life and the very future of civilization against the best and most brutal of Society's ruling class. 
                        There, he will stop at nothing to bring down his enemies... even if it means he has to become one of them to do so.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Raskolnikov, a destitute and desperate former student, 
                        wanders through the slums of St Petersburg and commits a random murder without remorse or regret. 
                        He imagines himself to be a great man, a Napoleon: acting for a higher purpose beyond conventional moral law. 
                        But as he embarks on a dangerous game of cat and mouse with a suspicious police investigator, 
                        Raskolnikov is pursued by the growing voice of his conscience and finds the noose of his own guilt tightening around his neck. 
                        Only Sonya, a downtrodden sex worker, can offer the chance of redemption.

                    <p>
                        In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. 
                        Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, 
                        nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, 
                        and that means comfort.
